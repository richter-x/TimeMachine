# What is this?
The RichterX TimeMachine (RxTM) is a global earthquake forecast database that you can query using an API. The forecasts are obtained by training a statistical forecasting model (Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence) retrospectively.

# Who needs this?
If you are interested in developing earthquake prediction algorithms RxTM is a massive, one-of-a-kind global training set. RxTM will give you the earthquake occurance probability for any location on the globe during the years 1990-2020. In addition, we provide you with the codes necessary to:
- generate earthquake predictions
- assign probabilities to predictions
- evaluate predictive skill

In this way you can train and test your earthquake prediction algorithm on the already available data, save time and proceed to prospective testing with greater confidence.

# How do I use this?
We have a [detailed tutorial](https://www.richterx.com/wiki/index.php/RichterX_TimeMachine) where you can run and intract with the code provided in this repository.
You can also refer to the [RichterX API documentation](https://www.richterx.com/wiki/index.php/RichterX_API) if you want to develop your own API calling functions.

Please report any issues that you encounter.
